      My friends call me Sam. I am an international student and have been living in United States for 5 years. I graduated last year from Purdue University majoring in Management and Marketing. I moved to California to do my full-time work in Marketing Industry. I worked for couples of months until I decided to join Coding Bootcamp to further my skills and career.

      I have one older sister. she currently lives in Indonesia, a country where most people do not know and located in Southeast Asia. I have a lot of interests; playing soccer and hangout with friends are just one of them. My friends say that I can make a joke that can turn sad people to laugh or smile. I do not know if it is true, but you can tell me the answer after you know me pretty well.
